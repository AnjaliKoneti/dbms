When i joined in college i was cried because until coming to college i have never been in a hostel so i felt very disappointed.

i was very sad and always thinking about home.

I was deviated and not able to concentrate on classes, always thinking about home , got headache frequently , always wanted to going home. Instead of being like that i can call to home and talk with them and mingle with my friends and concentrate on class, but i didn't do it.

I didn't call my parents because if i call them i will cry, and i stressed myself always feeling homesick and getting headache.

I have missed my classes so i missed the basics of the subjects and struggled to get over it.




While going to exercises at first i felt happy and slowly i wasn't showed interest to go to exercises, when i woke up i want to go but i can't because of my dizziness.

I felt that when i went to exercises i was feeling sleepy in classes and having body pains at first and we have to wake up early after exercises i have to struggle for washrooms because they will be full at that time because of that i have to skip breakfast sometimes and i will not be active in classes and coming late to classes.
